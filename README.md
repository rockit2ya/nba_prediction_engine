# 🏀 NBA Predictive Analytics Engine (v3.0)

This README covers the features, technical architecture, mathematical modeling, and deployment steps for the NBA Prediction Engine (engine).

### **Overview**

The **NBA Pro Engine (V3)** is a situational analytics tool designed for high-fidelity point spread predictions. Unlike basic models that use season averages, this engine prioritizes "Current Form" and "Immediate Context" to find market inefficiencies. It leverages the **NBA's Four-Factors** and advanced efficiency ratings to calculate a "Fair Line" (Projected Spread) for daily matchups. Unlike basic models that rely on season averages, this engine incorporates real-time injury scraping, fatigue adjustments (Back-to-Backs), and dynamic home-court weighting.

### **Key Pro Features**

- **Situational Modeling:** Factors in Back-to-Back (B2B) fatigue and dynamic Home Court Advantage (HCA).
- **Bayesian Star Tax:** Uses individual "On-Off" metrics weighted by official injury status (OUT, GTD, Doubtful).
- **Live Scoreboard V3:** High-reliability connection to real-time game schedules and scores.
- **Optimized Performance:** Multi-threaded API calls and persistent sessions for sub-2-second analysis.
- **Kelly Criterion Integration:** Calculates conservative bankroll risk for every edge found.
- **CLV Tracking:** Fetches live odds from The Odds API to measure Closing Line Value — the gold standard for proving real edge.
- **Emergency Fallback:** Continues working even if the NBA API is down using baseline league data.

## 🚦 Recommended User Workflow

Follow these steps to get the most out of the NBA Prediction Engine:

1. **Update and Fetch Data**
   - Before analyzing games, refresh all caches by either:
     - Running `bash fetch_all_nba_data.sh` from the terminal, or
     - Using the `[R] Refresh Data` command inside the engine UI.
   - This fetches advanced stats, injury reports, rest penalties, and news from ESPN/CBS/RSS.

2. **Analyze Games and Generate Recommendations**
   - Run the engine: `python nba_engine_ui.py`
   - The UI displays today's NBA schedule from cached data.
   - For each game, input the market line when prompted.
   - The engine calculates the fair line, edge, and confidence, factoring in:
     - Advanced stats (offensive/defensive ratings, pace)
     - Injury data (CBS/ESPN)
     - Late-breaking news (ESPN RSS)
     - Rest/fatigue penalties and dynamic home-court advantage

3. **Automated Flagging & Recommendation**
   - Every game shows a **bet recommendation** with a signal tier:
     - 🚨 **REVIEW REQUIRED** (edge > cap) — edge capped, model may be missing key info. Investigate before betting.
     - 🔥 **STRONG SIGNAL** (edge ≥ 5, HIGH confidence) — highest conviction
     - 📊 **LEAN** (edge ≥ 3) — moderate edge, worth considering
     - 📉 **LOW EDGE** (<3 pts) — thin margin, proceed with caution
   - The **edge cap** (default: 10 pts) is tunable via the Bankroll Tracker (`post_mortem.py` → [5] → [R]). Edges above the cap are clamped and flagged as suspicious.
   - If late-breaking lineup/injury news is detected, the UI will alert you to double-check before betting.

4. **Logging and Tracking**
   - Each analysis is logged to a date-stamped CSV (`bet_tracker_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`) for post-mortem review.
   - You'll be prompted for:
     - **Pick** — defaults to the engine's recommendation, but you can override with any team name
     - **Bet Type** — Spread (default), Moneyline, or Over/Under
     - **Sportsbook**, **Odds**, and **Bet amount** (all optional — press Enter to skip)
   - The engine automatically records the **Timestamp**, **Confidence** grade, and **ToWin** (calculated from your odds and stake).
   - When results are populated, `update_results.py` auto-calculates the **Payout** column using American odds math.

5. **Post-Analysis**
   - Run `python update_results.py` to auto-populate WIN/LOSS results from the NBA API.
   - Run `python post_mortem.py` for the full performance analyzer:
     - **[1] Single-Day Post-Mortem** — detailed win/loss breakdown with injury and margin analysis
     - **[2] Lifetime Performance Dashboard** — all-time record, ROI, streaks, drawdown, and pro-level verdict
     - **[3] Edge Calibration Report** — do bigger edges win at higher rates?
     - **[4] Daily Trend & Profit Curve** — cumulative P/L over time with ASCII chart
     - **[5] Bankroll Tracker** — real-dollar bankroll tracking with Kelly bet sizing

This workflow ensures your predictions are based on the most current cached data, with built-in alerts for late-breaking news and injuries, and a clear audit trail for every bet.

> **⏰ NBA API Scoreboard Timing:** The live scoreboard (`scoreboard.ScoreBoard()`) shows the **most recent completed slate** until the NBA rolls over to the next day's games, typically around **10–11am ET**. If you launch the engine early in the day, you'll see last night's final scores instead of tonight's upcoming games. This is normal NBA API behavior — not a bug.
>
> **💡 Use the `C` (Custom) command** to analyze any matchup immediately without waiting for the scoreboard to update. Just type `C`, enter the away and home team names, and the engine will run the full analysis using your cached stats, injuries, and rest data. This is the recommended workflow for early-day analysis or when the API is slow to refresh.

## 📊 Post-Bet Analysis: Entering Wins & Losses

After games finish, update your bet tracker CSV and run the post-mortem tool to review model accuracy.

### Step 1: Update Results (Automatic)

Run the result updater to automatically fetch final scores and populate WIN/LOSS:

```bash
python update_results.py
```

The script will:

1. List all available `bet_tracker_*.csv` files with their pending/complete status
2. Let you select a specific file or update all pending files at once
3. Fetch final scores from the NBA API
4. Determine WIN/LOSS based on whether your pick covered the spread
5. Save the updated CSV with results and final scores

**Example output:**

```
  Available bet tracker files:

    [1] bet_tracker_2026-02-10.csv  (4 games, 4 pending)
    [2] bet_tracker_2026-02-09.csv  (11 games, all complete)
    [A] Update ALL files with pending games
    [Q] Quit

  Select: 1
  ✅ G1: Pacers @ Knicks → WIN  (Final Score: Pacers 115 - Knicks 108)
  ❌ G2: Clippers @ Rockets → LOSS  (Final Score: Clippers 99 - Rockets 112)
  🟰 G3: Lakers @ Suns → PUSH  (Final Score: Lakers 110 - Suns 120)
```

### Step 1b: Manual Update (Alternative)

You can also edit the CSV directly. Open the bet tracker CSV and change each row's `Result` from `PENDING` to `WIN` or `LOSS`. Add the final score in the `Notes` column for margin analysis.

| Column        | Value                                | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Timestamp`   | `2026-02-12 13:17:16`                | Auto-recorded when the bet is logged                          |
| `Confidence`  | `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`              | Model confidence grade (auto-saved from engine)               |
| `Pick`        | `Bucks`, `Thunder`, etc.             | Defaults to recommendation; can be overridden                 |
| `Type`        | `Spread`, `Moneyline`, `Over/Under`  | Bet type (defaults to Spread)                                 |
| `Book`        | `DraftKings`, `FanDuel`, etc.        | Sportsbook (optional, entered at bet time)                    |
| `Odds`        | `-110`, `+150`, etc.                 | American odds (optional, entered at bet time)                 |
| `Bet`         | `50`, `100`, etc.                    | Dollar amount wagered (optional)                              |
| `ToWin`       | `89.29`, `150.00`, etc.              | Auto-calculated from Odds and Bet amount                      |
| `Result`      | `WIN`, `LOSS`, `PUSH`, or `PENDING`  | Auto-populated by `update_results.py` or set manually         |
| `Payout`      | `95.45`, `-50`, `0.00`, etc.         | Auto-calculated from Bet/Odds on WIN/LOSS/PUSH                |
| `ClosingLine` | `-5.5`, `+3.0`, etc.                 | Consensus closing spread from The Odds API (auto-populated)   |
| `CLV`         | `+1.5`, `-0.5`, etc.                 | Closing Line Value — how much better your line was vs closing |
| `Notes`       | `Final Score: Team1 123 - Team2 110` | Auto-populated or set manually for margin analysis            |

### Step 2: Run the Post-Mortem Analyzer

```bash
python post_mortem.py
```

You'll see a menu with five options:

```
  [1] Single-Day Post-Mortem
  [2] Lifetime Performance Dashboard
  [3] Edge Calibration Report
  [4] Daily Trend & Profit Curve
  [5] Bankroll Tracker
  [Q] Quit
```

### Menu Options

**[1] Single-Day Post-Mortem** — Enter a date to review that day's bets:

- Win/Loss/Pending counts for all bets and high-signal bets (Edge ≥ 5)
- Loss details with margin of defeat, injury impact, and low-edge flags
- Win details with average margin of victory
- Day P/L in units and real dollars (when bet amounts are tracked)

**[2] Lifetime Performance Dashboard** — All-time aggregate stats:

- Overall record, win rate, and letter grade (Elite / Pro-Level / Profitable / Below Breakeven)
- Total P/L in units and Kelly-weighted units
- **💰 Real Money P/L** — net profit/loss in dollars, total wagered, and ROI (or setup tip if no bet amounts tracked)
- **Sportsbook breakdown** — win rate and P/L per book (or tip to enter book names when logging)
- **Confidence breakdown** — win rate by HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW grade (or note if data unavailable)
- High-signal bet performance
- **📈 CLV Summary** — average Closing Line Value, positive CLV rate, CLV by wins/losses (or setup guide if no odds cached)

> **What is CLV?** Closing Line Value measures whether you got a better number than the final market line at tip-off. Sportsbooks don't provide this — you calculate it yourself:
>
> 1. Record the line when you place your bet (your **Market Line**)
> 2. The engine caches the consensus closing line from 15+ sportsbooks right before tip-off
> 3. **CLV = Closing Line − Your Market Line** (positive = you beat the market)
>
> Why it matters: research shows that bettors who consistently beat the closing line are profitable long-term, regardless of short-term variance. CLV is the single best predictor of real edge vs. just running hot.

- Edge calibration (do bigger edges win more often?)
- Streaks, max drawdown, and current balance
- Daily trend table (with dollar P/L column when available)
- **Pro-Level Verdict** — 6-point checklist:
  - ATS Win Rate > 52.4% (break-even at -110)
  - Positive ROI
  - High-Signal Win Rate > 55%
  - Edge Calibration (higher edges = higher win rate)
  - Sufficient Sample Size (20+ bets)
  - Positive CLV (beating closing lines, when data available)

**[3] Edge Calibration Report** — Fine-grained breakdown by edge bucket (0–3, 3–5, 5–8, 8–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20+) with visual bars, P/L, and Edge-vs-Win-Rate correlation.

**[4] Daily Trend & Profit Curve** — Day-by-day P/L with cumulative rolling win rate and an ASCII profit curve chart.

**[5] Bankroll Tracker** — Set a starting bankroll, unit size, and edge cap, then track day-by-day balance changes with real dollars. Includes Quarter-Kelly recommended bet sizing based on lifetime win rate. Press `[R]` to reset your settings (bankroll, unit size, edge cap) when you're ready to scale up.

## 🛠️ VS Code Installation & Setup (macOS)

### **Step 1: Open Your Project**

1. Launch **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Go to `File > Open Folder...` and select the folder containing your `.py` files.

### **Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

This keeps your project libraries isolated and prevents "Module Not Found" errors.

1. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Terminal > New Terminal`).
2. Type the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

```

3. You should now see `(.venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**

Run this command in your VS Code terminal to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### **Step 4: Fetch NBA Data & Set Up API Keys**

Run the data fetcher to populate all caches (stats, injuries, news, odds):

```bash
bash fetch_all_nba_data.sh
```

**Optional — Enable CLV Tracking:**

1. Sign up for a free API key at [the-odds-api.com](https://the-odds-api.com).
2. Copy the template and add your key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and replace "your_api_key_here" with your real key
```

The engine works without this — CLV columns will simply be left blank.

### **Step 5: Select the Python Interpreter**

1. Press `Cmd + Shift + P` and type **"Python: Select Interpreter"**.
2. Choose the one that starts with `./.venv/bin/python`. This ensures VS Code uses the libraries you just installed.

### **Step 6: Run the Engine**

1. Open `nba_engine_ui.py` in the editor.
2. Click the **"Play"** button in the top-right corner, or type this in the terminal:

```bash
python nba_engine_ui.py

```

## 🧠 The "Nitty-Gritty": How the Engine is Modeled

The model operates on the principle that NBA games are won by possession efficiency. It translates advanced ratings into a point spread using the following multi-layer logic:

### 1. The Core Efficiency Formula

We calculate the expected point differential per 100 possessions by cross-referencing offensive and defensive ratings over a **rolling 10-game window**:

$$Raw\ Diff = (OffRtg_{home} - DefRtg_{away}) - (OffRtg_{away} - DefRtg_{home})$$

This value is then normalized to the projected pace of the game:

$$Points_{spread} = Raw\ Diff \times \left( \frac{Pace_{avg}}{100} \right)$$

### 2. Situational Adjustments (The "Edge")

To move beyond a 50% accuracy rate, the engine applies three situational layers:

- **Fatigue Adjuster (B2B):** Detects if a team played the previous night. A **-2.5 point penalty** is applied to tired teams to account for drops in rebounding and defensive intensity.
- **Dynamic Home Court (HCA):** Instead of a flat +3.0, the engine calculates a team-specific HCA based on their season-long Home vs. Road Net Rating.
- **Star Tax (Injury Impact):** Scrapes live injury reports. If a star is out, the engine looks up their individual `On-Off Plus/Minus` and subtracts that value from the team's total power rating.

### 3. The Sanity Check (Volatility Filter)

If the **Calculated Edge** (Difference between Engine Line and Market Line) exceeds **11.0 points**, the engine flags the game as high-volatility. This usually indicates a market-moving event (like a trade or late scratch) that the math has detected but requires human verification.

### 📉 Mathematical Modeling Section

The engine uses a series of possession-based linear equations to derive the fair value of a matchup.

#### 1. Efficiency Differential ()

We first calculate the net efficiency margin by comparing how each team's offense performs against the opponent's defense:

$$Raw\ Diff = (OffRtg_{home} - DefRtg_{away}) - (OffRtg_{away} - DefRtg_{home})$$

#### 2. Pace Normalization

Since is calculated per 100 possessions, we must scale it to the game's projected (the total number of possessions for both teams):

$$Points_{spread} = Raw\ Diff \times \left( \frac{Pace_{avg}}{100} \right)$$

#### 3. Situational Final Line ()

The final projected spread incorporates the Dynamic Home Court Advantage (), the Fatigue Adjustment (), and the Star Tax ():

$$Fair\ Line = Points_{spread} + HCA + \sum Rest + \sum Injury$$

## 🛠️ Edge Cap & Review Required

When the engine's predicted edge exceeds your **edge cap** (default: 10 pts, tunable via `post_mortem.py` → [5] → [R]), the edge is clamped and the game is flagged as **🚨 REVIEW REQUIRED**. This guardrail exists because historically, extreme edges (15+ pts) have performed at ~40% — worse than moderate edges — suggesting the model is probably reacting to noise rather than a true market inefficiency.

For example, here's how the engine flagged suspicious edges on the **February 8, 2026** slate, where massive injury-report noise drove inflated predictions:

### 🔍 Example Breakdown

| Game              | Edge          | Why the Alert Triggered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **G1: NYK @ BOS** | **12.59 pts** | **The Tatum Factor:** Jayson Tatum is officially **OUT** (Achilles). Your engine's "Star Tax" likely hammered the Celtics' rating, while the market is still giving them a -3.5 favorite status based on their depth.                                                               |
| **G3: IND @ TOR** | **16.24 pts** | **The Zubac/Haliburton Void:** This is a "chaos" game. The Pacers are missing Tyrese Haliburton and Ivica Zubac, while Toronto has several "Questionables." The 16-point gap suggests the market thinks Toronto is healthy, while your engine sees two depleted rosters.            |
| **G4: LAC @ MIN** | **10.6 pts**  | **Clippers Trade/Injury Flux:** The Clippers are listed with several "Out" players (Garland, Mathurin, Jackson) due to pending trades and injuries. Your engine likes the Clippers +9.5 because it sees Minnesota's Poeltl being out as a bigger net-negative than the market does. |

### 🛠️ How to Handle these Alerts

When you see an edge above your cap (default: 10 pts), the engine caps the displayed edge and shows a **🚨 REVIEW REQUIRED** warning. The cap is tunable — adjust it in the Bankroll Tracker (`post_mortem.py` → [5] → [R] Reset Settings → Edge Cap). Use the "Human in the Loop" method:

1. **Check the "Questionables":** For G1, the Knicks have **Karl-Anthony Towns, Josh Hart, and OG Anunoby** all listed as Questionable. If all three play, your "Recommended Side" (Knicks) is a lock. If all three sit, that 12.59-point edge might actually vanish or flip.
2. **Verify the Scraper:** Since the scraper pulls from CBS, sometimes it misses a "Game Time Decision" (GTD) that was just announced on Twitter/X.
3. **The "Trap Line" Rule:** If your engine says the Knicks should be favored by 9, but Vegas has them as +3.5, ask yourself: _"What does Vegas know that my 10-game rolling average doesn't?"_ (Usually, it's a specific player matchup or a "revenge game" narrative).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Planned improvements to sharpen the model's accuracy and close gaps with market pricing.

### 1. Enhanced Star Tax — Usage-Weighted Injury Impact

**Status:** Planned

The current Star Tax uses on/off court plus-minus to estimate the impact of missing players. This undersells the effect of losing high-usage stars whose offensive burden can't easily be redistributed.

**Upgrade:** Weight the Star Tax by each player's **usage rate** and **minutes share**, not just on/off +/-. A 30% usage player being out has an outsized effect on the offense compared to a 15% usage player, even if their raw +/- is similar. This better reflects how the remaining roster absorbs the lost production.

**Expected impact:** More accurate injury adjustments for star-dependent teams (e.g., Luka/Mavs, Jokic/Nuggets), reducing false edges caused by the model undervaluing star absences.

### 2. Archetype Mismatch Flag — Targeted Defensive Adjustment

**Status:** Planned

Team-level defensive ratings capture overall defensive quality but miss **positional mismatches** caused by injuries. When a team loses its primary perimeter defender and faces a top-tier wing offense, the team DEF_RATING doesn't reflect the specific vulnerability.

**Upgrade:** Add a simple "archetype mismatch" flag that applies a **1–2 point adjustment** when:

- A team is missing its primary wing/perimeter defender (identified via defensive minutes and matchup data)
- The opposing team has a top-5 wing-heavy offense (high usage from wing players)

This is the one area where individual defensive performance actually matters and isn't already captured in team-level ratings.

**Expected impact:** Catches 2–4 additional edges per week that the current model misses, particularly in playoff-intensity matchups where defensive assignments are more targeted.

### 3. Travel Distance Adjustment

**Status:** TODO  
**Feasibility:** Easy — schedule data + city coordinates  
**Expected impact:** Medium

Long-haul travel measurably affects performance. Portland → Miami is brutal; LAL → LAC is nothing. Add a travel distance factor using arena coordinates and the schedule to apply a small penalty (0.5–1.5 pts) for cross-country flights, especially when combined with B2B or short rest.

Also accounts for **altitude** — Denver at 5,280 ft is a real factor; visiting teams shoot ~2% worse from 3 at altitude.

### 4. 3-Point Shooting Variance Regression

**Status:** TODO  
**Feasibility:** Easy — data already available in team stats  
**Expected impact:** Low-Medium

If a team shot 42% from 3 over the last 5 games vs. their season average of 36%, pros expect regression. The current 10-game rolling window partially captures this, but doesn't explicitly model 3P% mean reversion. Add a regression-to-mean adjustment on recent 3P% to avoid overweighting hot/cold shooting streaks.

### 5. Referee Assignment Tendencies

**Status:** TODO  
**Feasibility:** Medium — data exists on NBA.com  
**Expected impact:** Medium

Individual refs have measurable tendencies: foul rates, home FT disparity, pace of play. Some refs call 15% more fouls than others — that directly affects totals and spreads. Sharp bettors track ref assignments (released ~9am ET game day). Add a ref-tendency adjustment when crew data is available.

### 6. Schedule Context — Sandwich Games & Time Zone Travel

**Status:** TODO  
**Feasibility:** Easy-Medium — schedule data analysis  
**Expected impact:** Medium

Beyond B2B detection, add:

- **Rest disparity asymmetry** — 3 days rest vs. 1 day rest matters more than 2 vs. 1
- **"Sandwich games"** — a team plays a weak opponent between two marquee games and historically underperforms
- **West coast teams playing early East coast games** (noon tips after flying east)
- **Time zone penalty** — teams crossing 2+ time zones on short rest

### 7. Lineup-Specific Net Ratings

**Status:** TODO  
**Feasibility:** Medium — available via `nba_api` lineup endpoints  
**Expected impact:** Medium

Go beyond "who's out" to model "who replaces them." Five-man lineup net ratings show how specific combos perform together. When a starter is out, _who_ gets those minutes matters more than the absence itself. Factor in minutes distribution shifts and rotation depth (a team missing its 6th man in a B2B is worse than missing them with 3 days rest).

### 8. Closing Line Value (CLV) Tracking

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Feasibility:** Medium (using The Odds API free tier — 500 req/month)  
**Expected impact:** High

Tracks whether the engine's fair line beats the closing line, not just whether the bet wins. CLV is the gold standard metric for professional bettors — a positive CLV over time proves the model has real edge, even during losing streaks.

**Implementation:**

- `odds_api.py` fetches live spreads from The Odds API and caches consensus lines from 15+ sportsbooks
- `fetch_all_nba_data.sh` automatically refreshes odds alongside other data
- `update_results.py` populates `ClosingLine` and `CLV` columns in bet tracker CSVs
- `post_mortem.py` lifetime dashboard shows CLV summary (avg CLV, positive CLV rate, CLV by result)
- CLV is included as a check in the Pro-Level Verdict (positive CLV = real edge)

### 9. Motivation & Game Theory Factors

**Status:** TODO  
**Feasibility:** Medium — requires season context logic  
**Expected impact:** Low-Medium

Account for non-statistical factors that move lines:

- **Tanking incentives** — teams in the lottery race actively lose late-season games
- **Playoff seeding strategy** — resting starters in meaningless late-season games
- **Revenge games** — traded players facing former teams within ~30 days perform above baseline (small but non-zero effect)
- **Division/rivalry intensity** — certain matchups consistently go under the total

### 10. Betting Market Structure Signals

**Status:** TODO  
**Feasibility:** Hard — requires real-time odds/market data  
**Expected impact:** High

Professional bettors don't just model the game — they model the _market_:

- **Steam moves** — sudden line movement from sharp books (Circa, Pinnacle) signals informed money
- **Reverse line movement** — line moves opposite to public betting percentages = sharp action
- **Stale lines** — smaller books are slow to adjust; pros arbitrage the gap

This is a data access problem more than a modeling problem — requires a live odds feed subscription.

### Design Principle

> **Don't bolt on raw individual stats.** Team-level ratings + Star Tax already encode most individual signal. Adding full box-score stats (PPG, RPG, APG) would double-count what's in the team numbers. Player-vs-player matchup data has tiny sample sizes and adds noise. The right approach is to **refine the existing adjustments** (Star Tax, injury impact) rather than adding a new layer of individual performance data.
>
> **Vegas's real edge isn't one secret factor — it's speed and data access.** They get injury confirmations 30 minutes before the public, they have proprietary player tracking data (Second Spectrum), and they process referee assignments instantly. The biggest alpha for a retail bettor isn't a better model — it's **timing** (betting before line movement) and **discipline** (only betting when your edge exceeds the vig).
